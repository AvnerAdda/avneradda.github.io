          I&apos;m a Data Scientist with a strong foundation in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science, 
          bringing over 6 years of hands-on experience in machine learning and artificial intelligence. 
          My journey began at ESILV where I specialized in FinTech and Risk Management, followed by 
          intensive training at Israel Tech Challenge where I honed my skills in cutting-edge ML/AI technologies.

          Currently at Deloitte, I work on implementing innovative AI solutions across various industries, 
          from Life Sciences to Banking. I&apos;m particularly passionate about Natural Language Processing and 
          building scalable AI systems. My expertise spans across AWS and GCP cloud platforms, where I hold

          When I&apos;m not working with data, I&apos;m either contributing to open-source projects or exploring the 
          latest developments in AI technology. I believe in building AI solutions that are not just powerful, 
          but also ethical and accessible.
